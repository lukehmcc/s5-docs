# Introduction

S5 is a decentralized network that puts you in control of your data and identity.

At its core, it is a content-addressed storage network similar to IPFS, but with some new concepts and ideas to make it more efficient and powerful.

This website is hosted on S5.

All relevant code can be found here: <https://github.com/s5-dev>

You can join the Discord Server for updates and discussion: <https://discord.gg/Pdutsp5jqR>

Discussion will be moved to a decentralized chat app powered by S5 when it's ready :)
