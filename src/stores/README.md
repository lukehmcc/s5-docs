# Stores

The S5 network and nodes supports multiple different storage backends.

S3 is the easiest to set up, Sia is the cheapest option.

Local stores all files on your server directly, so that usually only makes sense for a home NAS use case or a small number of files.

Arweave provides permanent storage for a high price.
